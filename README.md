This Python script performs a simple linear regression on an ice cream stand‚Äôs revenue based on temperature data. Below is a concise overview of what the script does:

Data Loading and Inspection
Reads IceCreamData.csv into a pandas DataFrame.
Displays the first few and last few rows for quick inspection.
Prints basic descriptive statistics and information about the dataset.

Data Visualization
Uses Seaborn and Matplotlib to create joint plots, pair plots, and linear regression plots.
Shows how temperature and revenue relate to each other.

Train-Test Split
Splits the data into training and testing sets (e.g., 80% training and 20% testing).
Helps evaluate model performance on unseen data.

Model Training
Creates a LinearRegression model from scikit-learn.
Trains the model with the training data to find the slope and intercept.

Prediction and Evaluation
Uses the trained model to predict revenue for the test set (and for arbitrary temperatures).
Calculates the ùëÖ2
R2 score to measure how well the model fits the data.
Visualizes training and testing results on scatter plots with fitted regression lines.
Simply place your IceCreamData.csv file in the same directory (or update the file path), install the required libraries (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn), and run the script to see the output and plots.
